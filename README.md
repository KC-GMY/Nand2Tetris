# Nand2Tetris — From NAND Gates to a Modern Computer

This repository contains my personal implementations of the **Nand2Tetris** project, based on the book and course *"The Elements of Computing Systems"* by Nisan and Schocken.

The goal of this project is to build a complete computer system from the ground up — starting from a single NAND gate and working all the way to a functional virtual machine, compiler, and operating system.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific stage in the hardware/software hierarchy:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01` - Boolean Logic         | Basic logic gates built from a single NAND gate. |
| `02` - Boolean Arithmetic    | Building ALUs and binary adders. |
| `03` - Sequential Logic      | Flip-flops, registers, and memory. |
| `04` - Machine Language      | Hack assembly and binary instruction set. |
| `05` - Computer Architecture | Design of the Hack CPU and memory. |
| `06` - Assembler             | Translator from Hack assembly to machine code. |
| `07` - Virtual Machine I     | Stack-based VM for arithmetic and memory access. |
| `08` - Virtual Machine II    | Control flow, function calls, and call stack. |
| `09` - High-Level Language   | Writing a Jack compiler. |
| `10+` - OS & Applications    | Building system libraries and sample apps. |

## 🎯 Goals of This Repo

- Practice bottom-up system design
- Gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture
- Reinforce concepts in logic, CPU design, and compilers
